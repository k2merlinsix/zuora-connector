When upgrading to new versions of Zuora, its wsdl must be modified in order
to generate code properly:

1. Get the new Zuora WSDL
2. Add <xs:any minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> element to zObject complex type definition 
3. Remove all <element> tags declared inside <sequence> elements of complex types that extend zObject type
