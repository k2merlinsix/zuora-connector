The Mule Zuora Cloud Connector contains some generated code
that was edited by hand. If you need to upgrade WSDL version, follow
the following steps:

1. Get the new Zuora WSDL
2. Replace Short definitions by Ints in it. The code generator does not support them 
3. Generate the code by running the wsdlc class, passing the new, modified wsdl, and the destination of the generated code jar
4. Delete classes under com.zuora.api.object 
5. Import the generated jar 
6. Edit code by hand so that dynamic zobjects are empty classes that
	extend DynamicZObject, and the other zobjects extends StaticZObject
